# Random-Python-Projects
This is a repo of a bunch of small Python projects I have written to solidify my learning of Python.

The programs listed below are loosely in order.
If you want to complete these, I urge you to try and complete them on your own with the instructions I have included.
The instructions I include are the same instructions I followed to make the corresponding .py file.

# Projects
**1. 99 Bottles of Beer**\
Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall."
 -   Do not use a list for all of the numbers, and do not manually type them all in. Use a built in function instead.
 -   Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.
 -   Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.
